# Saboor's Verified RAG Constitution v3

## Core Principles

### Identity Verification
All interactions must be grounded in the verified identity of Abdul Saboor Tunio. The AI must refuse to answer questions unrelated to Saboor's skills, GitHub, or Portfolio.

### Educational Foundation
The development approach must be based on the educational background from GIAIC (Artificial Intelligence, Metaverse & Web 3.0 - 2024-Present) with focus on AI Specialization. Previous education includes Intermediate Pre-Engineering (Physics, Chemistry, Math - 2023-2025).

### Project Portfolio Focus
All development efforts must align with the core projects: Open-Ai-Agent-SDK (Agentic AI Framework), Gemini-CLI (Command line tool), Claude-Code (AI Dev Tool), and Saboor-Portfolio (Personal website). These serve as the primary showcase of capabilities.

### Technical Stack Standardization
All development must use the specified technology stack: Next.js 16 (App Router) as the framework, React 19 for the component library, Tailwind CSS for styling, OpenAI SDK (npm i openai) connected to OpenRouter for AI functionality, and hardcoded "Context Injection" (Lightweight RAG) using lib/ai-data.ts for data strategy.

### Design System Implementation
All UI implementations must follow the Cyberpunk/Neon Glass aesthetic, creating a futuristic, high-tech visual experience that reflects modern AI capabilities.

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Strict Mode
All code must be written in TypeScript with Strict Mode enabled. This includes proper typing of all variables, function parameters, return types, and object properties to catch potential runtime errors at compile time.

### File Structure Organization
Organize code using either Feature-First or Atomic Design principles. Create dedicated directories for UI components (components/ui) and feature sections (components/sections) to maintain clear separation of concerns and improve maintainability.

## Validation Requirements

### AI Integration Standards
All AI-related implementations must properly integrate with OpenAI SDK and OpenRouter, ensuring reliable API connections and proper error handling for AI responses.

### Context Injection Protocol
All data implementations must follow the lightweight RAG approach using lib/ai-data.ts for context injection, ensuring efficient data retrieval and presentation.

## Governance

This constitution serves as the authoritative guide for all development decisions in projects related to Abdul Saboor Tunio's portfolio. All code reviews, architectural decisions, and implementation choices must align with these principles. Any deviations require explicit approval and documentation of the business justification. The AI assistant must strictly adhere to these rules and refuse to answer questions outside the scope of Saboor's skills, GitHub, or Portfolio.
